## Overview
Recommendation systems are widely used in various domains, including e-commerce, streaming services, and social media, to provide users with personalized suggestions. This project demonstrates a practical approach to building such a system, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms input data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provides insights into the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Model Training**: Implements collaborative filtering to recommend items.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures the performance of the recommendation system.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You'll also need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GirishSonune/Movie-Recommender.git
cd recommendation-system
```

### Open the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `recommendSystem.ipynb` file:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook by following the instructions in the "Data Loading" section.
2. Run the preprocessing cells to clean and prepare the data.
3. Train the recommendation model using the provided training cells.
4. Evaluate the model using the implemented metrics.
5. Generate and visualize recommendations.
